Module 5: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development

5.1 Introduction to GUI Programming

-Overview of AWT, Swing, and JavaFX

Java provides three GUI frameworks, each with different architectural principles:

AWT (Heavyweight Components): Uses peer-based rendering (delegates UI to OS).

Swing (Lightweight Components): Uses pure Java UI, decoupled from OS, customizable.

JavaFX (Scene Graph-Based): Uses CSS, FXML, and hardware-accelerated rendering.

Swing follows the Single-Threaded Rule, requiring updates on Event Dispatch Thread (EDT).

JavaFX uses a retained mode graphics engine (better for animations).

JavaFX vs. Swing: JavaFX supports GPU acceleration, while Swing relies on CPU-based rendering.

JavaFX Application Lifecycle: init(), start(), stop().

-Event-Driven Programming

Java's event-driven model follows the Observer pattern, using low-level and high-level event handling:

Low-level events: Component-level interactions (MouseEvent, KeyEvent).

High-level events: Abstract interactions (ActionEvent, WindowEvent).

Event Propagation: Uses capture, target, and bubble phases (JavaFX).

Concurrency considerations: GUI operations should run on the EDT using SwingUtilities.invokeLater().

5.2 Building User Interfaces with Swing

-Creating Windows with JFrame

JFrame is the foundation of Swing applications, offering:

Lifecycle Management: pack(), setVisible(), dispose().

Double Buffering: Prevents flickering in complex UI rendering.

Pluggable Look and Feel: Custom themes using UIManager.

Thread Considerations: Swing components must be updated on EDT.

-Adding Components (Buttons, TextFields, Labels)

Swing components follow MVC architecture, separating logic from UI.

Components inherit JComponent, allowing custom rendering.

Thread considerations: UI updates must be handled inside SwingUtilities.invokeLater().

-Layout Managers

Swing layouts use dynamic component positioning based on container size.

Custom layouts can be implemented by extending LayoutManager.

Performance impact: GridBagLayout is more expensive due to its flexibility.

-Event Handling and Listeners

Java event handling uses observable patterns for efficient UI response.

Thread safety: GUI updates must be handled on EDT.

Event Propagation: Captures events at multiple levels in JavaFX.

5.3 Advanced Swing Components

-Menus and Toolbars

Swing’s menu system is based on the Composite design pattern, enabling hierarchical structures.

JMenuBar acts as a container, holding multiple JMenu components.

JMenu follows lazy instantiation, meaning submenus load when accessed.

Threading Considerations: UI updates for menus should be handled on EDT.

Accessibility Features: Mnemonics (setMnemonic()) and accelerators improve usability.

Toolbars vs. Menus: Toolbars provide quick access, while menus offer structured navigation.

Dynamic Menus: Menus can be updated at runtime by adding or removing menu items dynamically.

Popup Menus (JPopupMenu): Context-sensitive menus that appear on right-click.

-Dialogs and Pop-ups

Swing dialogs follow the Template Method Pattern, providing flexible UI interactions:

JDialog operates within its parent window, ensuring it remains on top.

Threading Considerations: GUI updates in dialogs must run on the EDT.

Look and Feel Customization: Dialogs can be styled using UIManager.

Data Validation in Pop-Ups: Custom dialogs enforce input validation before submission.

Lifecycle Management: setVisible(true), dispose() to manage memory efficiently.

Asynchronous Execution: Non-modal dialogs allow concurrent user interactions.

Integration with Components: Dialogs can contain forms, tables, or interactive elements.

-Tables and Trees

Swing’s JTable and JTree offer high-performance rendering mechanisms:

JTable’s MVC Architecture: Separates data (TableModel), view (JTable), and controller (TableCellEditor).

Custom Renderers (DefaultTableCellRenderer): Modify table cell styles dynamically.

Event Handling: ListSelectionListener captures user selections in tables.

Memory Optimization: Large tables use lazy data loading (TableModel.getValueAt()).

Hierarchical Data Structures: JTree nodes are instances of DefaultMutableTreeNode.

Custom Editors for JTree: Implements TreeCellEditor to allow node modifications.

Concurrency Considerations: Background data loading should use SwingWorker to avoid UI freezes.



5.4 JavaFX Overview

-Setting Up JavaFX

JavaFX is a modular framework optimized for UI development, following the MVC pattern.

JavaFX Runtime: Uses a hardware-accelerated graphics engine for smooth rendering.

FXML for Declarative UI: Uses XML-like structure to separate UI from logic.

JLink & JPackage: Enables self-contained application packaging.

Multithreading Considerations: JavaFX applications must update the UI on the JavaFX Application Thread using Platform.runLater().

Performance Optimization: Scene graph optimizations (setCache(true), setDepthTest(DepthTest.ENABLE)).

Event-Driven Programming: Uses EventHandler and PropertyBinding for dynamic interactions.

Custom UI Components: Extending Region or Pane allows building reusable UI elements.

-Building UI with FXML

FXML enhances JavaFX development by enabling component-based UI structures:

FXML Controllers follow MVC architecture, ensuring clean separation of concerns.

Observable Properties: FXML elements bind to dynamic values (property.bind() for live updates).

CSS & FXML Integration: fx:style applies inline styling, but external .css files are preferred.

FXML Includes (<fx:include>): Allows modular UI design by reusing components.

FXML Event Propagation: Event bubbling and capturing enable nested event handling.

FXML Loaders and Memory Management: FXMLLoader.setControllerFactory() supports dependency injection for better performance.



-Styling with CSS

JavaFX CSS enhances UI customization while improving performance:

Selector Specificity: Inline > ID Selector > Class Selector > Default Style.

Performance Optimization: Use static stylesheets instead of inline styles.

CSS Property Binding: Can be dynamically updated via JavaFX Property bindings.

Custom Skins & UI Components: CSS enables theming for ListView, TableView, etc.

Pseudo-Classes: Styles different component states (hover, focused, disabled).

css
Button:hover { -fx-background-color: lightgray; }
JavaFX Scene Builder: Allows visual CSS customization for faster development.

-Animations and Effects

JavaFX animation engine supports GPU acceleration for smoother transitions:

Physics-Based Motion: Supports dynamic animations via spring-based interpolation.

Custom Animation Controls: Pause, resume, reverse animations dynamically.

Multi-Step Animations: Combine KeyValue pairs within a Timeline for complex movements.

Event-Driven Animations: Can trigger UI changes via onFinished event listeners.

Parallel Processing: Run animations in background threads for improved performance.
