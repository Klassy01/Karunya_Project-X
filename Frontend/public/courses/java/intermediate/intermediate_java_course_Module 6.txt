Module 6: Database Connectivity and Final Project

6.1 Introduction to Databases

-SQL and Relational Databases

Relational databases use structured relationships between tables:

Primary Key ensures unique identification of records.

Foreign Key establishes a relationship between tables.

Normalization Forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF) optimize data integrity.

ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ensures transaction reliability.

SQL queries allow filtering (WHERE), sorting (ORDER BY), and grouping (GROUP BY).

Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN) combine data from multiple tables.

-Database Design and Normalization

A well-structured database follows normalization principles:

1NF: Ensures atomicity (each column stores only one value).

2NF: All non-key attributes depend on the whole primary key.

3NF: Removes indirect dependencies (data should depend only on primary key).

Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): Stronger version of 3NF, ensures strict functional dependencies.

Denormalization: Used when query performance is preferred over strict normalization.

Indexes: Used to speed up searches, but excessive indexing can slow down writes.



6.2 Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)

-JDBC Drivers and Architecture

JDBC follows a layered architecture for database connectivity:

JDBC API Layer: Provides standard interfaces for interaction.

JDBC Driver Layer: Implements database-specific communication.

Types of Statements:

Statement: Executes SQL queries without parameters.

PreparedStatement: Precompiled SQL queries for better performance.

CallableStatement: Calls stored procedures in databases.

Connection Pooling (javax.sql.DataSource): Improves performance by reusing connections.

-Connecting to a Database

Java connects to a relational database using JDBC API, which enables applications to send SQL commands.

The database URL format follows: jdbc:<database_type>://<host>:<port>/<database_name>.

DriverManager is responsible for loading the appropriate JDBC driver and establishing a connection.

Steps for Connection Lifecycle:

Load JDBC Driver.

Establish Connection using DriverManager.

Create a Statement or PreparedStatement.

Execute SQL commands.

Close connection to free resources.

Connection Pooling (javax.sql.DataSource) is used to reuse connections and improve efficiency.

-Executing Queries and Managing Transactions

Executing queries in JDBC involves prepared statements and transactions for efficient data handling:

Query Execution:

java

PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?");
pstmt.setInt(1, 1001);
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
Transaction Management:

Use SAVEPOINT for partial rollbacks:

java

Savepoint sp = conn.setSavepoint("Save1");
conn.rollback(sp);
Batch Processing (executeBatch()) optimizes multiple queries by reducing round trips to the database.

6.3 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with Hibernate

-Introduction to Hibernate

Hibernate is an ORM framework that enables automatic object-database mapping through annotations and XML configurations.

It abstracts SQL complexities and provides a HQL (Hibernate Query Language) to work with objects.

Components of Hibernate:

SessionFactory: Creates sessions for database interaction.

Session: Interface between Java objects and the database.

Transaction: Manages atomic operations.

It supports lazy loading, caching, and inheritance mapping for efficient querying.

Integration with Spring Boot allows seamless database connectivity.

-Mapping Java Objects to Database Tables

Hibernate maps Java objects to database tables using JPA annotations.

Primary Key Mapping:

@Id defines a primary key.

@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) enables auto-increment.

Column Mapping:

@Column(name="column_name") sets custom names for database columns.

@Transient marks a field not to be persisted in the database.

Relationships:

@OneToOne (one-to-one relation).

@OneToMany and @ManyToOne (one-to-many & many-to-one).

@ManyToMany (many-to-many).

-CRUD Operations with Hibernate

Hibernate uses Session API to perform CRUD operations efficiently.

Creating an Entity:

session.save(entity) adds a new row to the table.

Retrieving Data:

session.get(Class, id) fetches an object by primary key.

HQL Query:

java

Query query = session.createQuery("FROM Student WHERE id = :id");
query.setParameter("id", 1);
Updating an Entity:

Use session.update(entity), or modify a retrieved object and call session.merge(entity).

Deleting Data:

session.delete(entity) removes an entry.

Batch Deletion is optimized using createQuery("DELETE FROM Student").executeUpdate();.

6.4 Building a Complete Java Application

-Designing Database Schema

A well-designed database schema ensures data consistency, scalability, and efficiency.

Use entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) to visualize table relationships.

Implement referential integrity with foreign keys and cascading updates/deletes.

Optimize queries using indexes (CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table(column)).

Store large data efficiently using partitioning (PARTITION BY RANGE) for performance.

Use stored procedures and triggers to automate tasks like logging changes.

Consider NoSQL (MongoDB) vs. SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) based on project requirements.

-Developing GUI and Business Logic

Developing a GUI requires selecting the right framework (Swing for desktop, JavaFX for modern UI).

Business logic is implemented separately to maintain scalability and reusability.

Event Listeners (ActionListener, KeyListener) handle user inputs dynamically.

Implement form validation before sending data to the backend.

Use threads for responsive UI (SwingWorker for background tasks).

Design patterns like MVC separate concerns:

Model: Handles data and logic.

View: Displays UI elements.

Controller: Bridges model and view, processing inputs.

-Integrating Database with Application

Integrating a database involves setting up JDBC drivers and managing connections properly.

Use Connection and Statement objects for data transactions.

Prevent SQL Injection by using Parameterized Queries (?).

Transaction Management ensures atomic operations (conn.setAutoCommit(false)).

Use an ORM framework (Hibernate, JPA) to simplify database interactions.

Caching techniques (Ehcache, Redis) improve query performance.

6.5 Final Project

-Project Planning and Implementation

Successful project implementation requires clear planning, modular design, and structured execution.

Requirement Analysis: Gather functional and non-functional requirements.

System Design: Define application architecture (monolithic vs. microservices).

Version Control (Git): Track code changes using repositories (GitHub, GitLab).

Continuous Integration (CI/CD): Automate builds and deployments (Jenkins, GitHub Actions).

Unit Testing & Code Reviews: Ensure quality before deployment.

Deployment Strategy: Choose cloud services (AWS, Azure, Heroku) for scalability.

TDD (Test-Driven Development): Write tests before implementation.

Mocking Frameworks (Mockito, PowerMock) simulate dependencies.

Performance Testing (JMeter) ensures system stability under load.
